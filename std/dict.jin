;{ #include <glib-2.0/glib/ghash.h> }

;(
for now just use glib2 hashtables
https://docs.gtk.org/glib/struct.HashTable.html
https://docs.gtk.org/glib/struct.HashTableIter.html

maybe in the future we can implement dicts using adaptive radix tree

https://github.com/plar/go-adaptive-radix-tree

another option was linear hashing

http://www.cs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/554/Syllabus/3-index/linear-hashing-new1.html
https://github.com/amadvance/tommyds/blob/master/tommyds/tommyhashlin.h
but iteration over hash tables, which may be needed in some situations, is not efficient
