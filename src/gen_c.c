	after calling the init function, create a fixed number of threads (as many as CPU cores),
		and then run the main loop
	each thread runs a loop that processes the messages
	after each loop, if there are no messages left, it goes to sleep (sigwait)
	when a message is registered, a signal will be sent to all threads to wake up the slept ones

	the main loop only runs messages of UI actors (which are kept in a separate list); this means that:
	, a heavy computation that blocks its thread, can't make the UI lag
	, the UI remains resposive, even when the number of non'UI actors is extremely large
	the main loop runs messages of UI actors, and then polls (non'waiting) more events (glib2)
		if there is no more messages for UI actors, wait for events
	
	use mutexes to hold the list of actors and their message queues
