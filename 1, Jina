Jina is a programming language with sane memory management, actors, and a coherent syntax

Mahsa Jina Amini was a Kurdish girl whose tragic murder by the evil regime, started a revolution in Iran
at her funeral, these words were written on a stone above her grave:
	beloved Jina, you will not die, your name will become a code

memory management:
, in synchronous parts: compile'time reference counting
	"http://aardappel.github.io/lobster/memory_management.html"
	"https://www.toptal.com/software/eliminating-garbage-collector"
	"http://blog.skylight.io/rust-means-never-having-to-close-a-socket/"
, in asynchronous parts: runtime reference counting

numbers will always be copied into variables
	they are stored on stack  don't need compile'time/run'time reference counting
lists, dictionaries, and records are referenced by variables:
, in immutable variables:
	if they are small, they will be stored on stack
	if they are big, they will be stored on the heap, and reference counted at compile'time or runtime
, in mutable variables, a small part at the begining is stored on the stack
	this part will be referenced by variables in sync parts, and copied when captured by async functions
	so these types don't need heap allocation (and thus compile'time/run'time ref counting),
		as long as they are small

differnt stack sizes for each actor -> allocate stacks on the heap

actors are used to achieve lock'free concurrency
in Jina actors are preemptive (ie non'blocking), but very light

sharing mutable data in concurrent parts of a program is problematic
a data race happens when these three behaviors occur:
, two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
, at least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data
, thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data

to deal with it, programming languages choose different approaches:
, abandon concurrency altogether; make single threaded programs
, implement complicated and error prone lock mechanisms
, abandon mutability like in pure functional programming; but since at the end, mutability is necessary,
	a complicated mechanism like monads, linear types, effects, or Clojure reference types, must be used
	"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9132346/clojure-differences-between-ref-var-agent-atom-with-examples"
	"https://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/concurrency_and_parallelism/"
	any how, the lack of direct mutability, and the need for aggressive garbage collection,
		means that functional programming is not an efficient method
, use the approach taken by Pony "https://www.ponylang.io/"
	it controls aliasing (sharing) and mutability, using reference capabilities
	Pony's approach introduces many complexities, especially when dealing with generics
	i think the main reason for its complexities is that even class fields have reference capabilities

in Jina, mutable variables will be copied, when captured in async functions
so we can't mutate the environment of an async function; all mutations will be synchronous

types show us what we can do with the data, ie which operations are valid
inheritance is problematic:
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)"
"https://www.tedinski.com/2018/06/26/variance.html"
i feel that this problem was the motivation behind dynamic typing (another bad design)
to avoid this problem, some languages (eg Rust) have two kinds of types:
, concrete types can be instantiated, but cannot have subtypes
, abstract types cannot be instantiated, but can have subtypes
Jina does the same, without actually spliting types into two kinds

Jina compiles to C, and can easily use existing C libraries
